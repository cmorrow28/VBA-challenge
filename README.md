Module 2 Challenge

I really struggled to transfer my code over from the alphabet spreadsheet to the large spreadsheet, my Excel kept crashing, and I kept having to restart any edits I made. 

All the code I used came from course materials presented in class or from a tutor. Although I was unable to successfully run my code in the spreadsheet, I have included the code I was planning to test. 

code from my session with the tutor can be seen in lines 5 and 156.
